## Sparx Contributors Challenges
Sparx is a data preprocessing library which has been created to make feature engineering simplified. To be a part of the active contributor for sparx library, its mandatory to complete this challenge which helps you to understand the data wrangling and python optimization.

### Prerequisite

 - As `python version 2` has been retired this year, we recommend you to install Ananconda version 3.7 | [install](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
 - Git version control | [install](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
 - Any recommended code-editor [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
 - Better understanding of `pandas`,`numpy` python packages.
 - Create an account in Github.com and get your `username`.


### How to contribute.

 1. Visit after login into Github [https://github.com/cleverinsight-open-ai-foundation/challenges](https://github.com/cleverinsight-open-ai-foundation/challenges)
 2. Fork this `challenges` repository now you get exact copy cloned into your account.
 3. On your cloned repository you can see `clone or download`  green button. Click that button now copy your git repository `url`. 
 4. From you local machine open `terminal` if MacOs or `Right click > Git bash here` on windows machine. 
 5. Run the command `git clone url` url is the one you copied in step 3. For ex: `git clone https://github.com/cleverinsight-open-ai-foundation/challenges.git` and Press Enter.

## Problem Statement
`init.py` contains all codes for this challenges. There is a class called `Load` inside the `init.py` with lots of incomplete methods leftover intentionally. Now you can select any one incomplete method and solve using the `Docstring` given on the method definition.  

 - Once the method is filled with write logic's 
 - Test the method with different edge cases using `pytest`
 - Run `pylint init.py` and make sure the code is `PEP8` standard with `10/10` score.
 - `Git commit with correct message`
 - Now push the core into your repository using the command `git push origin master`.
 - Now send a `Pull Request (PR)` from your repo to the original source repo.
